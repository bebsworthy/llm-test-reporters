SUITE: Calculator
TEST: Calculator > addition > should handle negative numbers
FILE: /src/calculator.test.ts:12
TYPE: Assertion Error

EXPECTED: 0
RECEIVED: -2

CODE CONTEXT:
  10 |     it('should handle negative numbers', () => {
  11 |       const result = add(-1, 1);
> 12 |       expect(result).toBe(0);
     |                      ^
  13 |     });
  14 |   });
