# LLM TEST REPORTER - DETAILED MODE

## TEST FAILURE #1
SUITE: all-failing
TEST: All Failing Tests > Test 1 - Should fail
FILE: /Users/boyd/wip/reporters/typescript/jest-reporter/tests/all-failing.test.ts:5
TYPE: Assertion Error

EXPECTED: ) // Object.is equality
RECEIVED: ).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

CODE CONTEXT:
  3 | describe('All Failing Tests', () => {
  4 |   test('Test 1 - Should fail', () => {
> 5 |     expect('actual').toBe('expected'); // Will fail: Assertion error
    |                      ^

FAILURE REASON: Expected value ) // Object.is equality but received ).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality
FIX HINT: Check the expected value or fix the implementation to return correct result

## TEST FAILURE #2
SUITE: all-failing
TEST: All Failing Tests > Test 2 - Should fail
FILE: /Users/boyd/wip/reporters/typescript/jest-reporter/tests/all-failing.test.ts:10
TYPE: Type Error

CODE CONTEXT:

   9 |     const arr: number[] = null as any;

     |                ^

  12 | 

FAILURE REASON: Type error: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')
FIX HINT: Check variable types and ensure proper initialization

## TEST FAILURE #3

  14 |     await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  15 |     expect(true).toBe(true); // Will fail: Timeout (assuming test timeout is < 1000ms)

FAILURE REASON: thrown: "Exceeded timeout of 500 ms for a test.
Add a timeout value to this test to increase the timeout, if this is a long-running test. See https://jestjs.io/docs/api#testname-fn-timeout."
FIX HINT: Verify the assertion matches the actual behavior
