# LLM TEST REPORTER - DETAILED MODE

## TEST FAILURE #1
SUITE: chromium > validation.spec.ts > Validation Tests
TEST: chromium > validation.spec.ts > Validation Tests > should fail number comparison > chromium
FILE: /Users/boyd/wip/reporters/typescript/playwright-reporter/tests/validation.spec.ts:11
TYPE: Assertion Error

EXPECTED: 5
RECEIVED: 4

CODE CONTEXT:
   9 | 
  10 |   test('should fail number comparison', async () => {
> 11 |     expect(2 + 2).toBe(5);
     |                   ^
  12 |   });
  13 | 

FAILURE REASON: Expected value 5 but received 4
FIX HINT: Check the expected value or fix the implementation to return correct result

## TEST FAILURE #2
SUITE: chromium > validation.spec.ts > Validation Tests
TEST: chromium > validation.spec.ts > Validation Tests > should fail string assertion > chromium
FILE: /Users/boyd/wip/reporters/typescript/playwright-reporter/tests/validation.spec.ts:15
TYPE: Assertion Error

EXPECTED: "Goodbye World"
RECEIVED: "Hello World"

CODE CONTEXT:
  13 | 
  14 |   test('should fail string assertion', async () => {
> 15 |     expect('Hello World').toBe('Goodbye World');
     |                           ^
  16 |   });
  17 | 

FAILURE REASON: Expected value "Goodbye World" but received "Hello World"
FIX HINT: Check the expected value or fix the implementation to return correct result

## TEST FAILURE #3
SUITE: chromium > validation.spec.ts > Validation Tests
TEST: chromium > validation.spec.ts > Validation Tests > should handle array comparison > chromium
FILE: /Users/boyd/wip/reporters/typescript/playwright-reporter/tests/validation.spec.ts:19
TYPE: Assertion Error

CODE CONTEXT:
  17 | 
  18 |   test('should handle array comparison', async () => {

     |                       ^
  20 |   });
  21 | 

FAILURE REASON: expect(received).toEqual(expected) // deep equality
FIX HINT: Verify the assertion matches the actual behavior

## TEST FAILURE #4
