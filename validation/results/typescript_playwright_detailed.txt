# LLM TEST REPORTER - DETAILED MODE

## TEST FAILURE #1
SUITE: chromium > all-failing.spec.ts > All Failing Tests
TEST: chromium > all-failing.spec.ts > All Failing Tests > Test 1 - Should fail > chromium
FILE: /Users/boyd/wip/reporters/typescript/playwright-reporter/tests/all-failing.spec.ts:5
TYPE: Assertion Error

EXPECTED: "expected"
RECEIVED: "actual"

CODE CONTEXT:
  3 | test.describe('All Failing Tests', () => {
  4 |   test('Test 1 - Should fail', async () => {
> 5 |     expect('actual').toBe('expected'); // Will fail: Assertion error
    |                      ^
  6 |   });
  7 | 

FAILURE REASON: Expected value "expected" but received "actual"
FIX HINT: Check the expected value or fix the implementation to return correct result

## TEST FAILURE #2
SUITE: chromium > all-failing.spec.ts > All Failing Tests
TEST: chromium > all-failing.spec.ts > All Failing Tests > Test 2 - Should fail > chromium
FILE: /Users/boyd/wip/reporters/typescript/playwright-reporter/tests/all-failing.spec.ts:10
TYPE: Type Error

CODE CONTEXT:
   8 |   test('Test 2 - Should fail', async () => {
   9 |     const arr: number[] = null as any;
> 10 |     expect(arr.length).toBe(0); // Will fail: Type error - Cannot read property 'length' of null
     |                ^
  11 |   });
  12 | 

FAILURE REASON: Type error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')
FIX HINT: Check variable types and ensure proper initialization

## TEST FAILURE #3
SUITE: chromium > all-failing.spec.ts > All Failing Tests
TEST: chromium > all-failing.spec.ts > All Failing Tests > Test 3 - Should fail > chromium
FILE: /Users/boyd/wip/reporters/typescript/playwright-reporter/tests/all-failing.spec.ts:13

> 13 |   test('Test 3 - Should fail', async () => {
     |       ^
  14 |     test.setTimeout(500);
  15 |     await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

FAILURE REASON: Test timeout of 500ms exceeded.
FIX HINT: Verify the assertion matches the actual behavior

## TEST FAILURE #4
SUITE: chromium > mixed-results.spec.ts > Mixed Results
TEST: chromium > mixed-results.spec.ts > Mixed Results > Test 2 - Should fail > chromium
FILE: /Users/boyd/wip/reporters/typescript/playwright-reporter/tests/mixed-results.spec.ts:9

EXPECTED: 5
RECEIVED: 4

CODE CONTEXT:
   7 | 
   8 |   test('Test 2 - Should fail', async () => {
>  9 |     expect(2 + 2).toBe(5); // Will fail: Expected 5 but got 4
     |                   ^
  10 |   });
  11 | 

FAILURE REASON: Expected value 5 but received 4
FIX HINT: Check the expected value or fix the implementation to return correct result

## TEST FAILURE #5

  17 |     const obj: any = undefined;

     |                ^
